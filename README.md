## Project Overview

This project explores multiple machine learning and deep learning models to forecast solar radiation intensity for the next time point using historical time series data collected in Hawaii. The primary goal is to compare model performances and identify the most accurate approach.

## Models Implemented

- 1D CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)
- Transformer
- Regression Tree
- Random Forest Regression
- SVR (Support Vector Regression)
- TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network)

## Data

The dataset consists of time series records of solar radiation intensity measured in Hawaii.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kevinwang408/AI-project.git
    cd AI-project
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(List any additional installation notes here, e.g., Python version, CUDA requirements, etc.)*

## Usage

To train and evaluate models, use the provided scripts:

```bash
python train.py --model [MODEL_NAME] --data [DATA_PATH] --epochs [N]
```

**Supported model names:** `cnn1d`, `gru`, `lstm`, `mlp`, `transformer`, `regtree`, `rf`, `svr`, `tcn`

**Example:**
```bash
python train.py --model lstm --data data/hawaii_solar.csv --epochs 50
```

*(Add more usage examples, inference scripts, or Jupyter notebook instructions as needed.)*
